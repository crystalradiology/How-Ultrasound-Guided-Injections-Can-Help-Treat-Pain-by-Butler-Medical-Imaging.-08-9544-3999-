Cortisone injections can provide much-needed relief for ongoing and chronic pain. Cortisone helps reduce pain and swelling quickly by minimizing inflammation in a joint or around a tendon. The accuracy of these injections is critical, and ultrasound machines have significantly improved this accuracy by guiding the injection needle to an exact location under direct visualization. When a cortisone shot alleviates pain, it often enables a person to engage more effectively in other physical therapy or treatments needed for full recovery.
What Are Ultrasound-Guided Injections?
Ultrasound-guided images allow for the precise administration of cortisone injections. Just as an ultrasound can show a mom-to-be her unborn baby, it can also visualize different muscles, tendons, and joints in the body. These images guide a needle directly to the needed location for an injection. Ultrasound pictures are created using high-frequency sound waves, avoiding harmful ionizing radiation and allowing for safe and effective treatment.
Why Would I Need an Ultrasound-guided Injection?
A cortisone injection administered under ultrasound guidance provides a highly specific method of delivering medication into a targeted area. This precision is crucial, especially in cases where there are painful or sensitive areas near the injection site. Ultrasound-guided injections can treat a variety of conditions, including:
•	Arthritis
•	Bursitis
•	Tendonitis
•	Joint and muscle pain
•	Neck and back pain
•	Sciatica
•	Tendinopathy
How Are Ultrasound-Guided Injections Different from Other Cortisone Injections?
Ultrasound guidance offers a visual aid, helping to guide the needle accurately to the intended site. This ensures the medicine is precisely placed, leading to a higher likelihood of an effective outcome. Unlike traditional injections, the use of ultrasound provides real-time visualization of fluids and tissues, enhancing the precision of the injection.
What Happens During This Type of Injection?
The process for ultrasound-guided injections is similar to traditional injections, with added imaging for accuracy. Ultrasound gel is applied to the skin over the affected area to help obtain clear images. An ultrasound probe then captures the necessary views, which are displayed on a monitor. This helps pinpoint the injection site. The injection is administered using the same type of needle as in regular cortisone injections. These procedures are performed in our clinical offices during a standard patient visit without the need for anesthesia.
What Are the Benefits?
Ultrasound-guided injections offer several benefits, including:
•	Accurate Needle Placement: Ensures the cortisone is delivered to the exact location needed, increasing the efficacy of the injection.
•	Safety: Avoids the use of X-rays, reducing radiation exposure.
•	Non-invasive: Performed without the need for anesthesia, making it a straightforward and convenient option for pain management.
However, it is important to note that ultrasound-guided injections do not replace MRI or CT scans. While they are highly effective for guiding injections, diagnostic ultrasounds are used to visualize soft tissues and tendon attachments, providing valuable information with less risk for certain patients who cannot undergo MRI or CT scans due to conditions like having a pacemaker.
Post-Injection Care
After the procedure, patients are advised to rest the affected area and avoid strenuous activities for a few days. While some immediate pain relief may be experienced, the full effects of the cortisone injection can take a couple of days to become apparent. Patients should monitor their symptoms and follow up with their doctor to discuss the effectiveness of the treatment and any further steps that may be necessary.
